lab1b-client.c
==============
The client program will open a connection to a server 
(port specified with the mandatory --port= command line parameter)
rather than sending it directly to a shell. The client should then 
send input from the keyboard to the socket (while echoing to the display), 
and input from the socket to the display.

==============
lab1b-server.c
==============
The server program will connect with the client, 
receive the client's commands and send them to the shell, 
and will "serve" the client the outputs of those commands.

==============
Makefile
==============
A Makefile to build the program (compiling it with the -Wall and -Wextra options) and the tarball. 
It should have distinct targets for the client and server, 
but it should also have a default target that builds both. 
It should also have the (now) traditional clean and dist targets.
